0,Rand Paul wins 2015 CPAC straw poll,2015-02-28,"[Washington (CNN)Sen. Rand Paul won the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll for the third year in a row on Saturday, with 25.7% of the vote, event organizers announced Saturday at the National Harbor, Maryland, Confab. , But the biggest winner of the straw poll was perhaps Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who catapulted from fifth last year to second place this year and came in just four points behind Paul, with 21.4% support. He delivered one of the conference's best-received speeches, laying out his vision for the economy and drawing enthusiastic applause that overshadowed a tone-deaf answer he gave on foreign policy., The closely watched survey of conference attendees represents a small but vocal faction of the Republican party, and the voters tend to be younger and libertarian leaning as many college students attend the gathering. Paul won in 2014 and 2013, and his father, a libertarian icon and former Texas congressman Ron Paul won in 2010 and 2011. 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney won that year. , The poll has added significance because it's the last CPAC gathering before the 2016 presidential primary season kicks off, thought it is merely a preliminary survey of conservative sentiment, and its past results have rarely been predictive of the GOP's eventual nominee. While Mitt Romney won it in 2012, Gary Bauer, Rudy Giuliani and Steve Forbes have all previously taken the top spot at the conference before fizzling out in the presidential contest., In this year's poll, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz just barely edged retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, taking 11.5 percent to Carson's 11.4 percent support, largely unchanged from last year, when Cruz also took 11 percent and Carson took 9 percent support., Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush drew 8 percent for a fifth-place finish, a respectable showing that indicates conservatives are open to the establishment pick, and willing to overlook his moderate views on education and immigration reform.  Indeed, last year Bush declined to participate in the straw poll, and his aides downplayed his chances in this year's poll. , He delivered a strong performance during the conference, refusing to waver from his support for a legal status for immigrants and even handling a heckler with ease and good humor. But audible boos could be heard from the CPAC crowd on Saturday when Bush's name was read., READ: Jeb Bush survives — and thrives — at CPAC, The poll was perhaps more significant for the losers than the winners. , Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum's inability to break into the top five — despite emerging as the conservative favorite in the 2012 GOP presidential primary — suggests he faces an even steeper challenge in trying find a path to the nomination this year., Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 4% support, putting him in seventh place, also suggests he hasn't managed to heal some of the wounds he opened up with conservatives with his role in passing the Senate immigration reform bill in 2013., New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal — three of the GOP's more prominent potential contenders, who have been making the clearest moves towards a White House run — came in 10th, 11th and 12th places, respectively., That placed them behind real-estate mogul Donald Trump and former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, two Republicans seen as much longer shots for the nomination., In this year's survey, 3,007 participants voted, and nearly two-thirds, 63%, were women. As always, CPAC skewed young this year, with a plurality of respondents, 47%, between 18 and 25 years old., The CPAC straw poll offered a snapshot of conservative sentiment on policy issues ranging from immigration reform to the Department of Homeland Security funding fight currently raging on Capitol Hill. , Attendees were split on what to do with illegal immigrants currently in the country, with 37% saying they should be deported 27% saying they should be encouraged to return home and apply for citizenship legally and 18% saying they should be allowed to stay in the U.S. and apply for citizenship., More than three-fourths of attendees supported Congress using its ""spending power"" to try to defund President Barack Obama's executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrants, despite the fact that the measure cannot be defunded., And a plurality, 41%, support marijuana legalization, a poll result that drew loud cheers from the young crowd left in the final hour of the final day of the conference., RELATED: CPAC 2015: GOP White House contenders unite against Hillary Clinton]",052632_2015-02-28
1,Can Singing Mice Reveal the Roots of Human Speech?,2016-12-12,"[One chilly day in February 1877, a British cotton baron named Joseph Sidebotham heard what he thought was a canary warbling near his hotel window. He was vacationing with his family in France, and soon realized the tune wasn’t coming from outside. “The singing was in our salon,” he wrote of the incident in Nature. “The songster was a mouse.”, The family fed the creature bits of biscuit, and it quickly became comfortable enough to climb onto the warm hearth at night and regale them with songs. It would sing for hours., Clearly, Sidebotham concluded, this was no ordinary mouse., More than a century later, however, scientists discovered he was wrong. It turns out that all mice chitter away to each other. Their language is usually just too high-pitched for human ears to detect., Today, mouse songs are no mere curiosity. Researchers are able to engineer mice to express genetic mutations associated with human speech disorders, and then measure the changes in the animals’ songs. They’re leveraging these beautifully complex vocalizations to uncover the mysteries of human speech., * * *, Anecdotal accounts of singing mice date back to 1843. In the journal The Zoologist, the British entomologist and botanist Edward Newman wrote that the song of a rare “murine Orpheus” sounds as “if the mouth of a canary were carefully closed, and the bird, in revenge, were to turn ventriloquist, and sing in the very centre of his stomach.”, To explain this phenomenon, the British natural historians Gerald Barrett-Hamilton and Martin Hinton claimed in a 1921 review that the singing was a pathological behavior resulting from inflammation in a mouse’s windpipe, like a cough or wheeze. They didn’t suppose that illness simply lowered these animals’ voices—the way a bad cold does in people—which might actually be what happened to Sidebotham’s extraordinary mouse., In 1948, Wolfgang Schleidt, a zoology professor at the University of Vienna, was the first to show that all field mice vocalize in pitches too high for human ears to hear. About two decades later, Gillian Sales, a senior lecturer at King’s College London, who has devoted her career to studying rodent songs, used a tape recorder to listen to the songs by slowing them down to 1/20 normal speed. This had the effect of dropping the mouse’s register into the range of human hearing, but it also made the vocalizations sound a bit like the slow, repetitive glissando of a slide whistle., Analyzing these songs was incredibly tedious, Sales says. It all had to be done manually. Just measuring the pitch and duration of a few notes could take ten minutes. As a result, even though the following decades saw fruitful research on why and how mice sing, there wasn’t much focus on the structure of the songs themselves, according to Sales. No one thought of mice as a potential way to model human speech., The tide turned for mouse song in 1999, when a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech made a serendipitous discovery. Timothy Holy was looking for ways of identifying female-mouse sex pheromones, and he reasoned that pheromones in urine might cause males to make sounds. To him, the male’s high-pitched squeaks were simply good indicators of pheromones’ presence he didn’t even think of them as songs., , To listen in while his mice sniffed at the urine swabs, Holy recorded their vocalizations then lowered the pitch without slowing down the tempo. To his astonishment, he heard music coming from these little furry faces.   , “I noticed basically right away that these vocalizations were a lot more complicated than I had grown to expect based on the reading I had done on the literature,” says Holy, who’s now a neurobiology professor at Washington University, St. Louis. “I remember joking with my postdoc mentor at the time that maybe these were like birdsongs, basically.”, Although Holy’s pheromone experiment never panned out as he hoped, his rigorous characterization of mouse songs led to a seminal paper in 2005 in PLoS Biology. Other labs took notice, and mouse-song research exploded., * * *, Among the limited number of other mammals that communicate vocally—including humans, whales, elephants, dolphins, and bats—none are ideal for the laboratory. Mice, by contrast, are small, cheap, and easily genetically modified. Labs routinely delete or add genes to the mouse genome many transgenic mice can even be ordered from a catalog., When humans speak, their vocal cords vibrate at different frequencies like the strings on a guitar. People shape those sounds with the lips and tongue to form phonemes—the distinct units of speech—which come together to make syllables, words, and phrases. Mice lack vibrating vocal cords and an articulatory apparatus, but they can still volitionally utter streams of distinct syllables. So Holy sees the mouse as useful for exploring the rudimentary aspects of speech production that mice and men share., For a study published earlier this year, Holy teamed up with Dennis Drayna, the chief of the genetics of communications disorders section at the National Institutes of Health, to introduce a human stuttering gene mutation into mice. Lo and behold, the mice stuttered too. “I think many people are shocked that the mouse could have much relevance to any human-speech condition,” says Drayna. For speech disorders like stuttering or Tourette syndrome, the problem arises from initiating words rather than thinking them up, so mouse songs are a reasonable proxy., Currently there’s no cure for stuttering. Psychiatric drugs may be able to help, but so far, FDA-approved versions haven’t made any headway. To get new stuttering drugs to market, animal testing is essential, Drayna says. Stuttering mice now make those experiments possible., Mouse songs aren’t only pertinent to the study of speech initiation. They can also be used to study how complex sequences of speech form from simple building blocks. To examine this notion in mice, the Duke associate professor of neurobiology Erich Jarvis uses what he calls “sexy songs.” These are relatively elaborate courtship songs males belt out to woo a mate, and the lady mice love them., Jarvis engineered male mice to express a rare genetic mutation called FOXP2. Humans who carry a FOXP2 mutation have trouble stringing individual phonemes together to form complex words or sentences. Jarvis discovered that his mutant mice no longer sang their sexy songs, even in the face of a female in heat. Their simple chirps remained normal. It’s essentially the same speech pathology observed in humans with the FOXP2 mutation. His lab published these results in October., Jarvis takes this as evidence for his more general hypothesis that speech is not all-or-nothing. It evolved gradually, and the rudiments are present even in humans’ distant cousins, the rodents., Despite promising findings both in his lab and elsewhere, Jarvis, like his peers, is quick to point out that mouse song is not a perfect model for human speech. Most glaringly, unlike humans and birds, mice have scant abilities to modify their vocalizations through learning. But Jarvis thinks he can change that., In 2014, Jarvis’s lab published in Science that humans and songbirds both evolved changes in the way certain genes are expressed. These genes are the ones that allow humans and songbirds to alter what they say as a result of experience. Mice lack these evolutionary tweaks, but Jarvis is currently using genetic engineering to add them in. He hopes doing so will make mouse vocalizations more human-like, which would allow mice to serve as better models for human speech., There are plenty of genetic human speech disorders, and Drayna, Holy’s collaborator, thinks even as-is the mouse could be a reasonable model for many of them. While speech is unique to humans, it is the product of genes that are not unique to humans. Examining the more elaborate social songs may provide new insight into the evolutionary roots of human speech. For instance, some labs house mice together in social groups, and one of Drayna’s colleagues has observed that if you take one of the mice away for a few hours and then return him to the group, the cage bursts into boisterous song to greet him. It’s the most they ever sing., “You can only imagine what they’re saying,” Drayna says.]",071607_2016-12-12
2,Dollar hits 15-month low against yen after Yellen testimony,2016-02-10," The dollar fell to a 15-month low against the yen on Wednesday as investors packed into the safe-haven Japanese currency, backing away from earlier optimism that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise interest rates. Investors perceived dovishness on the part of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who testified before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday morning.  ""By the end of her testimony, sentiment completely shifted,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of BK Asset Management in New York. Because ""at the end of the day, everyone realizes the chances the Fed will be pulling the trigger next month have  diminished significantly."" Yellen told members of Congress that she does not expect the central bank to reverse the rate-increase program it began in December but highlighted the risk continued global financial volatility posed to the U.S. economy. ""For the most part, dovish undertones of (Yellen's) testimony were enough to reinforce what the market had been thinking all along,"" Lien said, ""which is that the Fed is probably not going to go through with a rate increase next month.""  After initialing turning positive against the yen following the release of Yellen's remarks, the dollar reversed course, falling more than 1 percent and touching a session low of 113.74 against the yen. It was the lowest the dollar has fallen since Nov. 5, 2014. The dollar was last down 0.95 percent at 114.01 yen. The Fed had indicated it would raise interest rates four times this year after increasing them in December for the first time in nearly a decade.  Increasing U.S. interest rates would make the dollar a more attractive currency for investors. But as crude oil futures have fallen along with U.S. stock prices, markets have grown increasingly wary of the likelihood the Fed will follow through on its forecast. Fed funds futures rates show that markets see less than a 6 percent chance of a rate increase in March, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, and only a 37 percent chance of interest rates going up this year. After earlier turning up from Tuesday's drop to 3-1/2-month lows, the dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against six major world currencies, turned flat at 96.101. The dollar did rise against the euro, which fell 0.35 percent as worries over the European banking sector continued to weigh. The euro   dropped 0.5 percent to a session low of $1.1161 following the release of Yellen's report. It was last down 0.3 percent to 1.1257.

3,Trump's Supreme Court pick dispirited by president's tweets,2017-02-09," Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, on Wednesday described as ""demoralizing"" and ""disheartening"" the U.S. president's Twitter attacks on a judge who suspended Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, a spokesman for Gorsuch said. Gorsuch's comments came as a federal appeals court in San Francisco was expected to decide in coming days on the narrow question of whether U.S. District Judge James Robart acted properly in temporarily halting enforcement of Trump's ban. A Republican strategist hired by the White House to help guide Gorsuch's nomination through the U.S. Senate said that Gorsuch, himself an appeals court judge, used those words when he met with Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, took to Twitter over the weekend to condemn the Friday night order by Robart that placed on hold the president's Jan. 27 temporary travel ban on people from the seven countries and all refugees.  Trump called Robart a ""so-called judge"" whose ""ridiculous"" opinion ""essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country."" Trump's administration appealed Robart's ruling to a three-judge federal appeals panel, which heard oral arguments  on Tuesday.  Presidents are usually hesitant to weigh in on judicial matters out of respect for the U.S. Constitution, which ensures a separation of powers among the president's executive branch, Congress and the judiciary.  The Republican-led Senate on Wednesday confirmed immigration hardliner Republican Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general despite strong Democratic opposition. Trump says his executive order aims to head off attacks by Islamist militants. The order, the most divisive act of Trump's young presidency, sparked protests and chaos at U.S. and overseas airports. Critics said the ban unfairly targeted people for their religion. ""I don't ever want to call a court biased,"" Trump told hundreds of police chiefs and sheriffs from major cities at a meeting in a Washington hotel on Wednesday. ""So I won't call it biased. And we haven't had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political.""  Trump nominated Gorsuch on Jan. 31 to succeed conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the nine-member Supreme Court. Scalia died a year ago this month.  Blumenthal, a member of the Judiciary Committee that will hold a confirmation hearing on Gorsuch, said the nominee had a responsibility to reassure Americans that he would be an open-minded and independent jurist by going public with his concerns about Trump. PRESIDENTIAL POWERS The appeals court decision on whether to reinstate the ban, will be just a first step in a fast-moving case. The courts will ultimately have to address questions about the extent of the president's power on matters of immigration and national security. Traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branch’s authority in such matters, legal experts say, although some note that the implementation of Trump's order presents unique issues. Trump's order barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except those from civil war-torn Syria, who are subject to an indefinite ban. Also at issue is whether the order violates a provision of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits laws favoring one religion over another, along with relevant discrimination laws.  PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES Trump, a Republican, has made extensive use of presidential directives that bypass Congress and has appeared to be taken aback by legal challenges to his travel order. He praised a federal judge in Boston who earlier ruled in his favor on the travel ban as a ""highly respected"" jurist whose findings were ""perfect.""  Last year, Trump accused Indiana-born U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of bias in overseeing a lawsuit against one of Trump's businesses, Trump University, because of his Mexican heritage. Democrats and other critics have called Trump's comments toward the judiciary an attack on a core principle of American democracy: that the courts are independent and uphold the rule of law.  At the meeting with law enforcement officials, Trump read from the law he cited to justify the travel ban, quoting it in fragments and sprinkling in bits of interpretation. He said the law clearly allowed a president to suspend entry of any class of people if he determined them to be a detriment to national security. The matter is likely to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is ideologically split with four liberal justices and four conservatives pending Senate action on Trump's nomination of Gorsuch, a conservative jurist. U.S. State Department figures showed that 480 refugees had been admitted to the United States since Robart's order went into effect, including 168 on Wednesday. Of those admitted, 198 were from war-torn Syria.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out a lower court's ruling prohibiting the use of public funds to pay for children to attend private religious schools, a day after it issued a major ruling narrowing the separation of church and state.

4,FULL TEXT: 10 Things Milo Hates About Islam - Breitbart,2016-09-27,"I’m Milo Yiannopoulos, thank you for coming. Tonight I have two objectives. The first is to be issued with a fatwa, which I surely will be any day now if I’m doing my job properly.[, advertisement, The second is to give you a more sober assessment, with the benefit of distance, about what happened in Orlando in June. , I was supposed to speak here at UCF back then. Following the terrorist attack at Pulse nightclub, I was planning on delivering a speech in the nice air conditioning of UCF on the dangers of Islam to the west. But the speech was cancelled.  The police felt they couldn’t protect me from many threats they received. I was perfectly happy to go on with the show my primary concern was speaking. Orlando isn’t Sweden….yet. Since I couldn’t speak at UCF, I delivered an address on Islam at ground zero, mere yards away from the Pulse night club. , The speech has been seen nearly a million times on my YouTube channel and over 5 million times in total. , A sober assessment, free of righteous indignation, doesn’t mean we can’t be funny. One of the first things to disappear in the wake of a terrorist attack is humour. That’s one of the things they want. They want to make us afraid. , When we’re afraid, we don’t dare laugh in case it’s the wrong thing to do. , But laughing is one of the ways we show we’re okay, and that there can be a future beyond what has happened. , We aren’t going to beat Islamic terror only with tanks and bombs. We’re going to beat it with ideology. We’re going to beat it with laughter — by showing the people who live in countries ruled by dictators and thugs that they will not make us afraid. By showing them that the West is best. , That’s how the Berlin Wall fell. People in East Germany knew that West Germany was better. , The freedoms enjoyed in this country, the best country, are, or should be the envy of the world. And when people are truly free, they laugh. They laugh about everything. , It’s often said that in order to find out who is in power, you have to find out who you’re not allowed to laugh about. , Today that’s feminists, Black Lives Matter and Islam. Those are the groups that will get you into trouble if you crack jokes about. You’ll have your newspaper column taken away. You’ll be banned from Twitter. , Of all these groups, Islam is the most inherently hilarious. , Their outfits are hilarious. Ridiculous. Is there anything more comically sinister than the sight of a herd of women swathed in black bedsheets? , Anything more unintentionally ironic about a religion that hates gays that gets its men in a room together 5 times a day to stick their asses in the air? , Is there anything more richly amusing than the crybully faux-victimhood of those who worry about “islamophobia” and hijab-pulling in the wake of terror attacks that leave dozens dead? , Is there — and perhaps this is just my gallows humour — anything more darkly funny than a religion so thin-skinned that cartoons designed to provoke it give rise to deadly shootings, as though to prove the point of those French cartoonists? , Is there anything more preposterous than the phrase “The Religion of Peace”? , Islam is really funny. , But it’s also sinister. And as a gay man, I really don’t like it very much. , It’s easy to bleat about Christianity. It’s low-hanging fruit. It’s more difficult, and it takes more bravery, to criticise Islam with sincerity and seriousness. And with jokes. , That’s what I’m here to do today. , Now originally I was going to call my talk 10 Things I Hate About Islam. But on the way over here I got carried away and couldn’t bring myself to keep it to just 10. So I changed the name of my talk.  , There are few people in the western world, save perhaps Daddy, Donald Trump, who have been falsely accused of sexism as much as I have. I mean, I championed GamerGate for God’s sake — and they still won’t shut up about it. But to be honest I think I’m more feminist than most feminists. I mean sure, I think birth control was a mistake and women are happier in the kitchen, but that’s just my opinion. If women want to ruin their lives with the Pill and a string of unsatisfying one-night stands, that’s up to them. I’ll always be here to comfort their unhappy ex-boyfriends. , Because I say things that offend feminists, the left considers me the number one threat to women today. But Muslims do far more than offend feminists, or offend women. , They’re actually enslaving them, forcing them into marriages, slashing their genitals — which, unlike the male genitalia, aren’t improved by a little trim. , Muslims think they own women to such a degree, that they think women who wear shirts above their ankles in European countries are fair game to be raped. That’s real rape culture, right there — not the bogus one on college campuses. , So, as long as I’m speaking out against Islam with a louder and more forthright voice than any feminist in America today, I feel justified in considering myself far more feminist than them. Even if I do hate abortion. , You’ve got a religion, in Islam, that not only bans alcohol, but bans bacon too. At least Jews are sensible enough to ban just one of those things. , The only thing more prescriptive and tiresome than Islam is my personal trainer. , Want to go to a strip club? Nope, sorry, haram. , Want to smoke cigarettes? Nope, ISIS will behead you for that. , Are you a tourist? Do you want to admire some historical monuments? , Nope, sorry, blown up. Snogging on a beach?  , As a Catholic, I can ask for forgiveness for my sins. , Muslims have their hands chopped off. Or worse. , The thing I always miss in discussions of Islam is what Muslims actually believe about God. , Christians believe in God, the Creator of heaven and earth, who loved his creation so much that he entered into it through the womb of a woman to become one with his creatures in their suffering. This understanding of God has huge implications for the society that forms with Christianity as it foundation: we believe in a creator who made us in his image. , The Christian God invites us to make beautiful things in his honor, and the great pantheon in the west is an expression of this divine permissiveness. Art, literature, music and drama in the west are expressions of the licence given to Christians to explore themselves and their relationship to the ineffable. , Islam does not see God in this way. Allah is said to be Compassionate and Merciful, but he does not, in the words of a medieval historian friend of mine, enter into his creation. , He does not invite his creatures to be fellow creators. In fact he forbids it. He forbids much of what we in the west know is responsible for all the best art. , He forbids creativity in robust, dangerous, experimental ways. This, I think, rather than any petty sexual restriction, is what means there can be no accommodation made for Islam from gays whatsoever. We are society’s engines of chaos, pushing the limits of what can be thought and said, testing the boundaries of creativity and acceptability, sketching out social norms for the rest of you. , In the west, art is mainstream. In Islam, it is law and submission and the incredibly prescriptive rules laid down for life that guide how society is ordered. The Muslim commander who conquered Alexandria asked the Caliph Umar what to do with the immense library there. According to one anecdote, told by Muslims, the Caliph Umar replied: “If what is written in the books agrees with the Koran, they are not needed. If it disagrees, they are not wanted.” , So the commander burned the library. Now this may be apocryphal but this story was originally told by Muslims and later repeated by famous Muslim writers.  , People accuse me of being a self-hating homo because I say that if I had the choice, I probably wouldn’t have chosen to be gay. , Once again, that’s just an opinion. There are many things about being gay that I don’t like, like not being able to make mini-Milos. , But I don’t want to be thrown of a building. Or stoned to death. Or beheaded. , I’d quite like someone to threaten to do that to me. Or pretend to. I mean, I’ll be honest, it’s tough for me to get off without a knife to my throat or a gun to my head these days. , But Islam really means it, and the Left refuses to see the danger. , America’s gay Establishment spent all of last week having a hissy fit because Out, a gay magazine, decided to write a reasonably balanced profile of me. , Hordes of homophobic Muslims are being imported to the west so they can shoot up gay nightclubs, and the left says nothing — except to blame it on “toxic masculinity.” , I’m the self-hater? No. The whiny gay leftists who cry when I say something offensive but are silent in the face of an existential threat are the self-haters. They hate themselves so much they want to commit suicide — suicide by Islamic immigration. , Now, let’s get theological again for a moment. The difference between submitting to God as Mary did and the way in which Muslims submit themselves to Allah is important. God, as Christians encounter him, takes his creatures as beloved and elevates them to share in his divinity, restoring them to the image and likeness in which they were created. , This kind of relationship is unthinkable in Islam. , In other words, Muslims find it offensive to think that God could have lowered himself to become incarnate, but they find they find it even more offensive to think that God would elevate his creatures to share in his divinity. , What does this have to do with women and gays? Well, the God of Christianity, the God of the Old Testament and of the New, is a God of fire, consumed with love for his creatures. So much so that he enters them as he did Mary and Rupert of Deutz, a 12th-century Benedictine. , What does this have to do with Islam and its attitude toward women and gays? Islamic men cannot bear to think of submitting themselves in this way to God, they can only imagine themselves as dominating women, and they hate gays because gays submit in a way that they never can, which is why I think they find homosexuality so frightening. How else to explain the unique viciousness of Islam toward homosexuals? 100 million people live in Muslim countries in which the penalty for homosexuality is death. The reason is subtle, but important, and if we don’t understand it, we can’t fight it. , Islam lacks authority. It’s headless, if you’ll forgive a cruel pun. So it lacks someone who can clean house or declare definitively that something is wrong or should be abandoned. But despite lacking authority, Islam doesn’t encourage the kind of one-on-one relationship with God that you see in Christian traditions. Instead, Islam is collectivist, almost egalitarian. You can see why so many lefties have a love affair with the religion.  They’re the Borg in more ways than one. , Islam encourages its members to see themselves as part of a larger community of equals, the Ummah. The egalitarian strain can be seen clearly in how Muslims descend on Mecca to walk around the kaaba, rich men and poor men and men of different races (all men, of course) circling the great black mass like insects surrounding their queen. , Because of its emphasis on community, Islam is more cult-like than other religions. You aren’t supposed to turn to a priest or an authority figure for support or guidance — you’re supposed to turn to the rest of the ummah. , Islam encourages itself to treat everyone within the religion like a brother to be trusted and supported, and everyone outside it to be feared and suspected. It’s no wonder that it encourages tribal outbursts of violence, particularly against those who defeat and humiliate the tribe, like Israel. , If you take philosophy in high school, you might be taught about a little dilemma in political philosophy called the paradox of tolerance. Tolerance calls for, well, everyone to be tolerated — but what happens if you tolerate the intolerant?, The cultural Marxist Herbert Marcuse used this paradox to argue for the suppression of western conservatives — people who aren’t really intolerant, at least not anymore. However, you’ll still see leftists trying to purge conservatives like Mozilla founder Brendan Eich from mainstream society, seemingly oblivious to the real threat, which is Islam. , The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. , Unlike nearly all of the Old Testament verses of violence, the verses of violence in the Quran are mostly open-ended, meaning that they are not restrained by historical context contained in the surrounding text, although many Muslims choose to think of them that way. , They are part of the eternal, unchanging word of Allah, and just as relevant or subject to interpretation as anything else in the Quran. Islam is more insular and hostile to outside thinking than a gender studies department. So it gives us a clear answer to the paradox of tolerance: no, you cannot tolerate the truly intolerant. , If you give them an inch, they’ll take a mile, and rape everything inside it. And they won’t stop spreading. There were 1.6 billion Muslims in the world as of 2010 – roughly 23 per cent of the global population – according to a Pew Research Center estimate. But while Islam is currently the world’s second-largest religion after Christianity, it is the fastest-growing one. The growth of Islam should be one of the most disturbing things in the world for liberals. Here is a religion that forces women into submission, that executes gays, that tries to kill non-believers. , They’re the Westboro Baptist Church on steroids, except they’re not mental trolls from Kansas. They mean it.  , And they’re spreading. , Islam preys on the most vulnerable in society, offering them a sense of higher purpose. It’s no wonder that gingers convert to Islam in such high numbers! , Islam today is like communism in the early stages of the Cold War. They’re presenting young, disaffected people with an idealistic, tribal, utopian vision that is drawing in millions. And like communism, it’s inspiring violence all around the world. If there’s one thing we learned from the battle with communism, it’s that the west can’t compromise on its values. It can’t apologize for itself, like the left constantly wants us to do. , Like Thatcher and Reagan, we must present future generations with a vision of the west that is compelling enough to beat Islam’s warped vision of the good society. , It isn’t hard to do. The superiority of the west is self-evident. We just need to discover the courage to talk about it, like Thatcher and Reagan did. And we need to talk about it loudly. , We hear a lot about moderate Muslims, but in practice we don’t see them. All the moderate Muslims I know are ex-Muslims, or haven’t been to Friday prayers for months, or even years. , London has elected a Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, who is praised as a moderate But many have been left wondering just how moderate he is.  , Khan banned sexy advertisements from the underground  like the famous Protein World ads.  Was this move really to combat body shaming, like feminists wanted? Or was it to make the underground more shariah-compliant?, It is one of those instances where feminism and Islam are right in line on women’s rights. Sadiq Khan has met with a lot of shady and decidedly non-moderate Islamic types. He has associated with convicted terrorist Babar Ahmad, who is credited with inspiring the gang behind the 7/7 bombings.  For those of you that don’t know, that was London’s smaller scale 9/11. This is a mayor who says terrorism is “Part &amp parcel of living in a big city” but it shouldn’t be, should it?, England is one of the most illuminating examples of the lack of moderates. A Gallup poll of Muslims in the UK found that not a single one of the 1,001 people polled thought that homosexuality was morally acceptable.  Not a single one!  , The entire world loves Malala, the Nobel Prize winning champion of education for girls.  But look at her opinion, which passes in the media as moderate: “The more you speak about Islam and against all Muslims, the more terrorists we create.”, So Malala’s opinion is if we all just shut up and did what Islam wants, which is to submit, they wouldn’t need to shoot us, stab us, or blow us up. , Criticise us and we will kill you for your bad words. Great to know a Nobel prize winner has this sort of vision. I can’t be the only person who reads that and takes it not as an exhortation to peace, but as a threat. , Muslim theology says God isn’t constrained, even by logic. If Allah wants to have 2 plus 2 equal 4 this evening but 5 tomorrow morning, he can. Recall the Muslim outrage in 2006 when Pope Benedict XVI, the best Pope, gave a lecture in Regensburg on faith and reason. Benedict dared to quote a medieval dialogue between a Christian and a Muslim that made clear Christians think “not acting reasonably is contrary to God’s nature,” whereas Muslims don’t believe God is “bound” by rationality. , Curtis Yarvin, a Jewish entrepreneur and blogger, says that nonsense is a better organizing tool than the truth. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” he writes. “To believe in nonsense is an unforgeable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform.” , For many Muslims, the nonsense that is “Islamic science,” which holds that the earth is egg-shaped and that the stars are missiles created by Allah to throw at devils, is the only science they need. , Or consider the ascendant art of “Islamic creationism,” a batty spin on creationist theories forged in Turkey but funded by Saudi Arabia. Scientific inquiry is virtually dead in the Islamic world. Arab nations stand near the bottom of every measure of human development. There is no world-class university anywhere in the Muslim world. , Spain translates more books in a single year than the entire Arab world has in the past thousand. Some people in Saudi Arabia still refuse to believe man has been to the moon. , I know some of you tonight probably don’t believe we’ve been to the moon either, but this is America. You are allowed to go against accepted opinion without being beheaded for it. , Historical revisionists and Islamic apologists like to bang on about the Golden Age of Islam, when the Arab world was the centre of learning and scholarship in the world. But this was a very brief moment in history, when the Arabs were translating Greek and Roman texts. , The Arab world had a brief period of scholarly advance because they happened to conquer some of the world’s leading libraries and translate the books. Big deal! , Many will talk endlessly about medieval Islamic doctors, scientists and mathematicians. But most of the men we think of were writing in Arabic because their lands had been conquered and they didn’t want their heads chopped off. They were actually Jews, Nestorians, Byzantines, Hindus, Copts, and other non-Muslims. Andrew Bolt on Sky News Australia, whose show I go on regularly because they get the lighting just right, perfectly encapsulated Islam’s integration problem in the west this week. He recalled the case of Dr. Ibrahim Abu Mohammed, the grand mufti of Australia, who gave a speech to explain to Australians that they are wrong to think Muslims can’t integrate into Australian culture. , There’s just one problem. The Grand Mufti, one of the foremost Islamic scholars in Australia, delivered the speech in Arabic. He has lived in Australia for 19 years, and his integration speech is in Arabic. That’s what I call chutzpah! , I wish older people like the Grand Mufti were the real problem. But they’re not. What we have witnessed in Europe is the younger generation being more separatist and radical than the older generation, the opposite of what you expect from immigrant populations.   , The differences in beliefs between Muslims in the west and the cultures they have moved to is striking. In England, 52% of Muslims believe homosexuality should be illegal, compared to 5% of the general population. And this isn’t just in Europe. It’s here in America, too. , In 2015 the Center for Security Policy commissioned a poll of Muslims in America. It found that: , And here’s my personal favourite:, That’s a lot of bad Skittles in the United States. Over a million of them. , Something we can all agree on is that the First Amendment, guaranteeing freedom of speech, is America’s most basic right. So it is very telling to understand the opinions of Muslims in America on this topic. According to a Wenzel Strategies poll in 2012: , You don’t only have to worry about the Muslims who commit acts of terror like shooting up a gay nightclub. You should also be worried about the Muslims who quietly endorse their acts. To say nothing of the ones who fund them. Since Islam views God as a non-rational tyrant, the religion naturally tends to produce bloodthirsty, irrational tyranny – a category that nicely covers ISIS, the Taliban, and many other Islamic regimes, including of course many major donors to the Clinton Foundation. , It would be nice if Islam had a way to reform itself out of these problems. But the unlikelihood of that is due in large part to our next reason to dislike Islam:, Integration in the west is one problem, but we must also consider integration in the east. Muslims can’t get along with anyone, including other Muslims. Just consider Iraq, where Sunni and Shia Muslims are constantly at odds. What we witness on a regular basis is that muslims insist on special treatment in the west, while treating minorities in their homelands terribly. The hypocrisy is blatant and unapologetic. The same Muslim groups who protest the ban on minarets in Switzerland in 2009 have no comment on the fact that it is illegal to build Christian churches in Muslim countries. 200 Subway sandwich shops in the United Kingdom removed all pork products and now carry only halal meat after outcry from the Muslim population. The Sunni Muslim Al Azhar University cut ties with the Vatican after the Catholic Church condemned persecution of Christians in the Muslim world. They considered it, quote, “interfering in Islamic affairs.” , Muslims in the west will decry any desecration of the Koran, but trust me you don’t want to be caught in the wrong place in the Middle East holding a bible. , In war-torn Syria, Christians face unimaginable persecution at the hands of the Muslim majority.  It is a curious fact that only 3% of the Syrian refugees brought to America are Christian. Could be the subject of a talk by itself. The best example of how Islam expects to be treated as a minority and how it then treats minorities is in Indonesia, which I wrote about along with my colleague Allum Bokhari. Indonesia is the largest Muslim country on earth, but is considered “moderate”, a designation that is essentially mythical. They’ve declared there is no room for gays in the country, which is no surprise as we’ve discussed earlier, but discrimination doesn’t end there. Chinese christians in Indonesia have a long history of persecution, which often involves beheadings.  They’ve gotten used to beheadings in Indonesia, and I find that horrifying. Indonesia is a secular country, but a whole region is now ruled by Shariah law, resulting in a 60 year old Christian woman being caned this year for the crime of selling alcohol. Does that sound like the type of treatment any minority deserves, anywhere?, I have no words. , This city, and this city’s gay community in particular, now understands the threat of Islam. If you’re all here at my talk, I’m guessing most of you understand too. But very few people out there do — the media refuses to talk about the problem, and will go to any lengths to conceal the background of a terrorist attacker or a rapist gang if that background is Muslim. , So it falls to us to wake people up. We are in an unenviable position — on the one hand, we’re defending America from the excesses of the left, and the threat they represent to free expression and freedom of association. On the other hand, we have to defend the good things that the left has achieved — women’s rights, gay rights, and tolerance — from the threat of Islam. Feminists won’t thank us for protecting them from Muslim patriarchs and rapists. Leftist gays won’t thank us for protecting them from being thrown off buildings and attacked in the street. Leftist atheists won’t thank us for protecting them from murderous theocrats. , But I know we’re going to do it anyway, because that’s what conservatives and libertarians do — the thankless, miserable, back-breaking clean-up operation. And we’ll do it with a smile. Because if we don’t, they win. , Thank you very much. Written from prepared remarks. , Follow Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.

5,5 Border Horrors Establishment Media Mostly Ignore,2017-04-23,"The brutality that comes from the open border between the U.S. and Mexico is often unreported or never brought up again after an initial report by news outlets in both countries — Mexican journalists often lose their lives for such reporting U.S. journalists simply avoid such reports for political reasons. Even in the cases where establishment media have covered the horrors, they do not include the previous reports in current news or discussions about border issues. Let’s look at five egregious examples.[1. “Rape trees” exist in remote regions of southern Texas and extend as far as 90 miles from the border. advertisement, Brooks County, Texas, is a remote area surrounding a secondary Border Patrol checkpoint nearly 100 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican cartel-linked human smugglers attempt to take groups of migrants around the checkpoint — often marching them 2-3 days in immense heat through dense brush so that they can reach a stash house. The smugglers’ culture takes pride in raping any of the migrants the smuggler deems as attractive and the rapist will often tie a garment from the victim, such a a bra, on the tree under which the rape occurred. Police and federal agents refer to these bra-vested trees as “rape trees.”, 2. The bodies of dead migrants are often found half-eaten by animals in remote border regions of Texas and Arizona. Authorities routinely find the dead bodies of migrants in The Rio Grande Sector of Texas and in the Tucson Sector of Arizona. In one Texas county, the remains of 552 migrants were discovered in a 10-year period. The Ajo area of the Tucson Sector also sees a large number of bodies discovered. Though these incidents have been reported, they are often not included in current discussions about border security or the pros and cons of changing aspects of border security. 3. Migrants who cross the border without a Mexican cartel’s permission can be subject to beatings and sodomy as retribution for crossing the cartel’s “turf” on U.S. soil. In August 2015, an illegal immigrant crossed through Sinaloa Cartel territory without permission in an effort to illegally enter the U.S. A cartel scout saw the man and ordered a SUV with four gunmen to intercept him. The event occurred near Tucson, Arizona. The illegal immigrant was hospitalized and medical staff spent hours in surgery removing shards of wood from the man’s rectum. He had been severely beaten by the gunmen and sodomized. 4. The bodies of dead migrants have ended up thrown into mass graves in Texas without ever having been identified. This horror occurred in the same Brooks County mentioned previously in this piece. Forensic anthropologists from several universities were horrified to discover that this was occurring and that some were buried in piles and others were buried in kitchen trash bags. 5. Families in Central America often put their daughters on birth control before their illegal journey to the U.S. because there is the expectation of multiple rapes along the way. As Breitbart Texas previously reported:, Women and young girls from Central America are routinely given birth control or morning after pills by their mothers in anticipation of the likely sexual assaults that will occur on their illicit journey to the United States. These females are often raped immediately upon making it to their first stop once they arrive in a Mexican stash house from Guatemala. They then are shipped to the U.S.-Mexico border, usually to Reynosa, Mexico, immediately south of McAllen, Texas. In the process of making it from the first stash house to the second, the women and young girls are often sexually assaulted or raped again by the smuggler–or group of smugglers–taking them between the two locations. The sexual assaults and rapes then often happen again in the second Mexican stash house of their journey. They are then trickled into the U.S. across the porous border and brought to a third stash house in a U.S. border town, usually in or near McAllen, Texas. They are often sexually assaulted or raped again by the operator of the stash house, if they are deemed attractive by the criminals operating the clandestine facility. They are stockpiled until the cartel wants to send a large load of narcotics across the Rio Grande. The cartel then sends a large load of humans across in one area and then a drug load across in another. Once the human beings are in Texas, another smuggler then picks up the women and young girls and drives them with a coyote to a point along Highway 281 just before the Border patrol checkpoint immediately south of Falfurrias, Texas. The checkpoint is approximately 85 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border. This shocking report is not just from Breitbart alone, as even the Huffington Post reports that 80 percent of female migrants are raped or sexually assaulted on the journey from Central America to the U.S. Brandon Darby is managing director and editor-in-chief of Breitbart Texas.

6,Crew members injured as plane avoids near collision with suspected drone,2016-11-14,"A Canadian airliner with 54 passengers on board had to swerve to avoid a suspected drone near Toronto early on Monday, slightly injuring two cabin crew, in the most serious case of its kind in Canada, officials said. ,  The Porter Airlines Bombardier Q400 twin-prop plane, which took off from Ottawa, was at 9,000ft (2,750 meters), descending into the city’s Billy Bishop waterfront airport, when the pilots saw an unmanned aerial vehicle. , “Two crew members performed an evasive maneuver to avoid the unidentified object,” said Genevieve Corbin, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB). Corbin said the object was most likely a drone., Two cabin crew suffered slight injuries during the incident, Porter said.  “The pilots’ initial assessment was that it looked like a balloon. After debriefing, there is potential that the object was a drone,” said Porter Airlines spokesman Brad Cicero. ,  The plane landed at about 7.30am ET (12.30 GMT). The TSB has now launched an investigation, the first time it has done so for such an incident, said Corbin. ,  In June, Canada’s federal transport ministry launched a campaign intended to deter people from flying drones near airports or aircraft. ,  There have been a rash of near-misses between planes and unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States in recent years. ,  In April, police in Britain said a British Airways passenger aircraft collided with what was most likely a drone as it prepared to land at London’s Heathrow airport. The aircraft landed safely and no injuries were reported in the incident. , , ",120386_2016-11-14
7,Bodies Of Missing Married Couple Found On Suspected S.C. Kidnapper's Land,2016-11-10,"[The bodies of two more presumed victims of Todd Kohlhepp, the South Carolina man who has confessed to multiple murders, have been identified as a young married couple who went missing in late 2015. Kohlhepp was arrested last week after a woman was found chained in a storage container on his land in Woodruff, S.C., After Kala Brown was found alive but imprisoned on Kohlhepp's nearly 100-acre property, the body of her boyfriend, Charles Carver, was found nearby. The couple had been missing since late August. Now the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office says it has found the remains of another couple on the property, and that both victims appear to have died from gunshots., Meagan Leigh McCraw Coxie, 25, and her husband, Johnny Joe Coxie, 29, were reported missing in December of last year. The couple has at least one child, officials say., ""Kohlhepp has also confessed to killing four employees of a motorcycle shop in 2003 — a long unsolved case. He's confessed to seven murders in total,"" South Carolina Public Radio's Cooper McKim reports for our Newscast unit. ""Investigators say active investigations continue on the expansive property, though the search may move beyond South Carolina. Officials say Kohlhepp owned several properties."", Of the Coxies, local TV news WSPA reports:, ""Deputies say that the couple panhandled near Interstate 26. The Coxies were released from jail in December 2015. Meagan told her mother that she had gotten a job and asked to be bonded out of jail, and her mother agreed, [Lt. Kevin] Bobo said., ""Meagan's mother reported the couple missing to the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office later that same month, according to authorities."", The TV station also relayed a statement from Johnny Coxie's relatives, in which they said, ""The family is in shock, grieving, and are not comfortable talking to anyone at this time. They have asked for people to please try and understand and give them time to heal. They appreciate everyone's love and concern."", As The Two-Way reported this past weekend:, ""When she was found on Kohlhepp's nearly 100-acre property, Brown told law enforcement agents that as many as four bodies could be buried there — prompting Wright to tell journalists Thursday, ""We're trying to make sure we don't have a serial killer on our hands.'

8,"350 Square Feet, Two Kids, Two Cats and a Rabbit - The New York Times",2017-03-17,"Maligned though New York’s rental market may be, a fortunate few do manage to stumble onto the ideal apartment early and easily. Such was the case with Sacha Moore, who scored a charming one-bedroom with a working fireplace in Brooklyn Heights (with the help of her sister) when she and her husband moved back to the city from New Orleans in 2003. At 350 square feet, however, it seemed an unlikely candidate for the long haul. But 14 years, two children, two cats and a bunny later, Ms. Moore is still in her beloved Middagh Street walk-up. “As soon as I moved to this neighborhood, I was like, ‘I love it — good job, sister!’” Ms. Moore said. She was delighted by its prettiness, how much everyone who lived there seemed to like it and how it felt both idyllic and down-to-earth, a place of not only stately houses but long-term renters. Her husband attended law school and she got a master’s in social work. He went to work for Brooklyn Defender Services. She prepared court reports. Though small, the apartment felt suitable for two. The birth of their daughter in 2008, however, made them reconsider. (The couple separated three years ago and are now divorced.) “I feel like we hit a wall around the time Charlotte was born,” Ms. Moore said. But in addition to their apartment being lovely, it is rent-stabilized. When they moved in the rent was $1,300 a month it is now $1,654. In Brooklyn, they looked in Windsor Terrace and Sunset Park, but found only slightly more space in the same price range. For about a day, they considered the suburbs. They abandoned the search after they saw an apartment in Bushwick with the bathroom in the hall that rented for $1,700 a month, $200 more than they were paying at the time. It drove home, Ms. Moore said, “that’s what you got if you didn’t want to pay more — a bathroom in the hall.” “When we thought about what we wanted, which was more space in Brooklyn, ultimately it came down to someone would have to make more money,” she said. Her husband did not want to leave his job as a public defender and Ms. Moore, who has worked part-time since Charlotte was born, wasn’t willing to work full-time. Her son, Hudson, came along a few years later. “I chose being with my kids,” she said. “And I was O.K. with staying here because I knew we’d have to move to get more space and I didn’t want to move. The question is: Can you make the space work?” The couple addressed the apartment’s constraints by eschewing bulky items like a highchair, crib or stroller. She carried the children until they were old enough to walk, occasionally resorting to a laundry cart. Longer excursions are made on a cargo bike. The only real difficulty, Ms. Moore said, was when Hudson developed a proclivity for wandering when he was between 18 months and 2½. These days, Ms. Moore and the children share the two closets in the bedroom quite comfortably, thanks to their pared-down wardrobes and the Marie Kondo folding technique, which mainly seems to involve intricately folded clothing standing upright rather than lying flat. While Ms. Moore does not subscribe to all the recommendations of the Japanese decluttering guru, she said that Ms. Kondo’s method saves so much space they don’t need dressers. “I always think, ‘How many clothes do you need?’ Because everyone wears the same outfit all the time anyway,” she said. “There’s some statistic that 80 percent of our clothes go unused most of the time.” While not a clotheshorse, Ms. Moore does admit to a fondness for pottery and plants — there are 42 plants in the apartment — and to occasionally being tempted by furniture. “Sometimes I see a cool bench and I’m like, ‘I want this, but I know it won’t fit,’” she said. “But then I think about how I’m making those choices. I could work full-time, or move out of the city or move to the South Bronx.” The children sleep in the bedroom, taking turns between the double bed and the futon, while Ms. Moore stays on a futon in the living room. She reclaims the bed on nights when the children stay with their father. The cats avoid the bunny, Foo though uncaged, he rarely leaves the vicinity of his food and litter box. Possessions are kept to a minimum: Charlotte, now 8, has a shelf of dolls Hudson, now 5, a shelf of toys, and the children share a shelf of books. As Charlotte explained, “I used to have a box with Barbies in it, but I never played with it, so Mommy feng shui’d them.” Ms. Moore acknowledged that their setup isn’t for everyone. “Some people, living in such a small space would make them feel claustrophobic,” she said. “And maybe at some point, this won’t work for us anymore. “It’s different for different people. Especially because it’s not just about the space, it’s about the stuff. People need a lot more space to put their stuff in. There’s this idea that if you can get more space, you’ve won.” “The American dream,” Charlotte interjected. “Part of it is I can’t afford more space, but part of it is I would rather own fewer things and love everything I own,” Ms. Moore said. “This is what works for me.”",184514_2017-03-17
9,CDC warns about deadly mushrooms amid surge in poisonings,2017-06-02,"Dangerous wild “death cap” mushrooms in California have poisoned more than a dozen people, including some who required liver transplants and a toddler who suffered permanent brain damage, according to a new report. The deadly spore — named   — is believed to be the world’s most dangerous mushroom, but is often confused with perfectly edible straw and Caesar’s mushrooms. Fourteen people were sickened last year after a bumper crop of the mushrooms, caused by abundant rainfall and warm weather, popped up in the greater San Francisco Bay Area,   by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that was published Friday. Three had to undergo liver transplants — including the 18-month-old child, who chowed down on just half a mushroom cap. The baby girl was left with permanent brain damage. The tot’s 26-year-old mother said the toxic ‘shrooms were given to her by a “person she did not know, who reportedly picked them earlier in the day in the mountains,” the study said. The mom had grilled the mushrooms for her husband, their young daughter, her sister and a pal — who all had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea within the next day. The death cap’s amatoxins — toxic compounds — are able to withstand heat from cooking and quickly damage cells in the body once eaten,  Others who were sickened ranged in age from 19 to 93, and ate varying quantities of the mushroom, including a “shot” of mushroom juice and as many as eight caps. A 37-year-old man who’d picked two wild mushrooms in Santa Rosa was hospitalized for six days after eating just one, according to the study. Coma and death occur in more than 50 percent of those poisoned. Death cap poisonings have been reported in California, Oregon and New York. The mushroom is common in the San Francisco Bay Area, but rare in most parts of North America.",106098_2017-06-02
